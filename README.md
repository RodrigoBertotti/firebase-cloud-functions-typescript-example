# Complete Firebase Cloud Functions TypeScript Example

A Node.js REST API example with Google Cloud Functions for Firebase,
built with TypeScript, Express, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Admin SDK, and Firestore.
It also handles Event Triggers (2nd gen) so all your code is organized.
This project fits well to be used as a template for the creation of new servers.

The main aspects of this sample are:

-  **An API HTTP Trigger:**
 
   - A well-organized API under the `api` folder
   - Access Control: Reject user access by simply choosing what user roles can access a specific path or easily check the claims with a custom `request` object in the Request Handler
   - Reject a request anywhere by throwing `new HttpResponseError(status, codeString, message)`
- **Events Triggers (2nd gen):** 
   - A well-organized Events Triggers under the `event-triggers` folder

- Shared components between API and Event Triggers are under the `core` folder

## About this example

This example is a good start if you are building a 
Firebase Cloud Functions project.

### About the 2nd gen event triggers example

Every time a user or product is created, or a product is updated,
a new record is created in
the `db-changes` Firestore Collection that only admins can access,
the code for these triggers is inside the `event-triggers` folder.

The triggers are `onUserCreated`, `onProductCreated`, and `onProductUpdated`.

### About the `api` HTTP trigger

There are three roles: `storeOwner`, `buyer` and `admin`.
Anyone can create an account, but an `adminKey` is required to create 
a user with `admin` role.

#### What each user can do

Store Owners:
  - ✅ Create products
  - ✅ List public products data
  - ✅ Get full data of his own product
  - ❌ Get full data of other store owners' product
  - ❌ List records of changes made inside the DB, like "Product Blouse has been updated"

Buyers:

- ✅ List public products data
- ❌ Create products
- ❌ Get full data of a product
- ❌ List records of changes made inside the DB, like "Product Blouse has been updated"

Admins: 

- ✅ Create products
- ✅ List public products data
- ✅ Get full data of ANY product
- ✅ List records of changes made inside the DB, like "Product Blouse has been updated"

## Getting Started

In the Firebase Console:
 
1. Go to Build > Authentication > Get Started > Sign-in method > Email/Password and enable Email/Password and save it.

2. Also go to Build > Firestore Database > Create database. You can choose the option `Start in test mode`

### Deploying

Go to the `functions` folder and run `npm install`
to install the dependencies. After that,
go back to the root folder (`cd ..`) and run:

- `npm install -g firebase-tools` to install the Firebase CLI
- `firebase use --add` and select your Firebase project, add any alias you prefer
- And finally, run `firebase deploy`

## API Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used to verify
if the client is authenticated on Firebase Authentication,
to do so, the client side should inform the `Authorization` header:

### `Authorization` Header

The client's ID Token on Firebase Authentication in the format `Bearer <idToken>`,
it can be obtained on the client side after the authentication is performed with the
Firebase Authentication library for the client side. 
It can be generated by the client side only.

#### Option 1: Generating ID Token with Postman:

Follow the previous instructions on [Use Postman to test it](#using-postman-to-test-it) and pass
it as `Authorization` header value in the format `Bearer <idToken>`

#### Option 2: Generating ID Token with a Flutter Client:
```dart
final idToken = await FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.getIdToken();
// use idToken as `Authorization` header value in the format "Bearer <idToken>"
```

#### Option 3: Generating ID Token with a Web Client:
```javascript
const idToken = await getAuth(firebaseApp).currentUser.getIdToken();
// use idToken as `Authorization` header value in the format "Bearer <idToken>"
```

## Testing

### Option 1: Testing with Remote DB
To make tests remotely, check what is your **remote** functions URL: in the Firebase Console go
to **Functions** > and check the `api` url, it ends with `.cloudfunctions.net/api`.

### Option 2: Testing Locally with a local emulator

In case you want to make tests locally using the Firebase Emulator,
you can run `npm run emulator` inside the `functions` folder.

⚠️ Changes in the local emulator
**won't affect the remote db.**

Open the Emulator UI
on http://127.0.0.1:3005 > **Functions emulator** > and on the first lines
check the `http function initialized...` log, it shows your Local URL, it ends with `/api`.

### Using Postman to test it

**1.** Import the **[postman_collection.json](postman_collection.json)** file to your Postman

**2.** Right-click on the Postman collection you previously imported,
   click on **Edit** > **Variables** and on **api** replace the **Current Value** with
   your API URL. 

Make sure the URL **ends with** `/api` and remember that if you use the local
   emulator URL it won't affect the remote db.

   If you are testing using the local emulator, it will look something like: `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<your-project-id>/<region>/api`

   But if you are testing using the remote db, it will look like: `https://<your-project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/api`

**3.** Create an account on the `1. Create Account` Postman Request

**4.** Follow the login steps to get an ID Token on Postman:
   
   *It's better to use a library of Firebase Authentication on the Client Side
   to get the ID Token, but let's use this method for testing because we are using Postman only*

- **4.1.** In the Firebase Console > Go to Project Overview and Add a new **Web** platform

- **4.2.** Add a Nickname like "Postman" and click on Register App

- **4.3.** Copy only the **apiKey** field inside the `firebaseConfig` object

-  **4.4** Let's get the Firebase Authentication Token, on Postman, go to `2. Login on Google APIS` request
   example and pass the `apiKey` as Query Param, edit the body with your email and password and click on **Send**, 
you will obtain an `idToken` as the response.

-  **4.5** For the other requests, the `idToken` should be set in the `Authorization` header (type **Bearer**).
   Let's set it as Postman variable too, so right-click on the Postman collection 
   **Edit** > **Variables** and on **idToken** replace the **Current Value** with
   the user **idToken** you previously obtained.

## Access Control

This project uses custom claims on Firebase Authentication to
define which routes the users have access to.

### Define custom claims to a user

This can be done in the server like below:
```javascript
await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, {
    storeOwner: true,
    buyer: false,
    admin: false
});
```
### Configuring the routes

You can set a param (array of strings) on the `httpServer.<method>`
function, like:

```javascript
httpServer.get (
    '/product/:productId/full-details', 
    this.getProductByIdFull.bind(this), ['storeOwner']
);
```

In the example above, only users with the `storeOwner` custom claim will
have access to the `/product/:productId/full-details` path.

Is this enough? Not always, so let's check the next section [Errors and permissions](#errors-and-permissions).

## API Errors and permissions

You can easily send an HTTP response with code between 400 and 500 to the client
by simply throwing a `new HttpResponseError(...)` on your controller, service or repository,
for example:

```javascript
throw new HttpResponseError(400, 'BAD_REQUEST', "Missing 'name' field on the body");
```

Sometimes defining roles isn't enough to ensure that a user can't 
access or modify a specific data,
let's imagine if a store owner tries to get full details
of a product he is not selling, like a product of another store owner,
he still has access to the route because of his `storeOwner` custom claim,
but an additional verification is needed.

```javascript
if (product.storeOwnerUid != req.auth!.uid) {
    throw new HttpResponseError(
        403, 
        'FORBIDDEN', 
        `You aren't the correct storeOwner`
    );
}
```

### 🚫 Permission errors

- #### "Only storeOwner can perform this operation"
Means you are not logged in with a user that has the `buyer` claim rather
than with a user that contains the  `storeOwner` claim.

- #### "You aren't the correct storeOwner"
Means you are logged in with the correct claim, but you are trying to read other storeOwner's data.

- #### "Only admin can perform this operation"
Means that this operation requires to be logged with
a user that has the `admin` claim, but the current user hasn't.

- #### "Requires authentication"
If you forget to add the Authentication header

## Authentication fields on Express Request Handler

This project adds 3 new fields to the request object on the 
express request handler, 
you can also customize this on `src/api/@types/express.d.ts` TypeScript file.

### `req.authenticated` 
type: `boolean`

Is true only if the client is authenticated, which means, the client
informed `Authorization` on the headers, and these
values were successfully validated.

### `req.auth` 
type: [UserRecord](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/firebase-admin.auth.userrecord) | `null`

If authenticated: Contains user data of Firebase Authentication.

### `req.token` 
type: [DecodedIdToken](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken) | `null`

If authenticated: Contains token data of Firebase Authentication.
